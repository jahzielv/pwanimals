# PWAnimals - a Paw-gressive Web App 🙊🙉🙈

PWAnimals is a little PWA I built to teach myself about Service Workers and offline first experiences on the Web.

## What does it do? 🐫
PWAnimals shows you a random animal picture! Click the button to generate a new animal picture.

## How did you do it? 🦒

Blog post coming soon!

## Credits 🐅

- Animal pics come from [placeimg.com](https://placeimg.com/). 
- The loading spinner comes from [this neat site](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/).
